  "body": "Current Behavior:\nOur tool currently extracts the raw Markdown content from GitHub issue and Pull Request (PR) descriptions. This raw content includes HTML-style comments (e.g., `<!-- This is a comment -->`). While these comments are invisible when rendered on GitHub, they are currently included in the text passed to Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nProblem:\nIncluding these HTML comments in the input to LLMs is undesirable for several reasons:\n\n1. Increased Token Usage: Comments, even if hidden, consume valuable tokens, leading to higher processing costs.\n2. Potential LLM Confusion/Noise: Irrelevant or internal-facing comments can act as noise, potentially confusing the LLM or degrading the quality of its output.\n3. Accidental Information Leakage: Comments might contain draft notes, internal discussions, or sensitive information not intended to be processed or seen by the LLM or its subsequent outputs.\n\nProposed Solution:\nModify the tool to parse and remove all HTML-style comments (`<!-- ... -->`) from the fetched issue/PR descriptions before the content is sent to the LLM.",
